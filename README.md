## Motivation

I mainly wanted to create a project that uses Typescript in order to get more comfortable with writing type definitions. The fullstack implementation was just a bonus as I got to play around with Next.js API routes and connecting a Sanity CMS backend to a frontend client. 

I enjoyed learning and thinking through about the schemas that I needed to consider while working with Sanity CMS. I think thinking through the entire database design helps me learn more deeply about how to create and store data.

The theming was just a fun bonus (and so I wouldn't run out of ideas to write dummy data)

I completely underestimated the power of Typescript, and I think I've fallen in love with using typescript and will continue to incorporate typescript into my projects
